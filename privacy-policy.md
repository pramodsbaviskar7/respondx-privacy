# RespondX Privacy Policy

## Introduction
RespondX is a Chrome extension designed to generate AI-powered email responses in Gmail. This privacy policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

## Information Collection and Use
RespondX temporarily processes the following information:
- Email content: When you click the RespondX button while viewing an email in Gmail, the content of that email is sent to our API service for the sole purpose of generating a contextually relevant reply.

We do not collect or store:
- Personal identification information
- Authentication information
- Web browsing history
- Any other information beyond what is necessary for generating email responses

## Data Storage
Your email content is processed temporarily and exclusively for generating responses. No email content or user data is stored permanently on our servers. Once a response is generated, the original email content is immediately discarded.

## Third-Party Services
We use a dedicated API endpoint (gmail-llm-based-auto-reply.vercel.app) to process email content and generate responses. This third-party service adheres to strict data protection practices and does not use your data for any purpose other than generating the requested responses.

## User Controls
You maintain full control over when RespondX processes your data:
- The extension only activates when you explicitly click the RespondX button
- You can review and modify any generated response before using it
- You can uninstall the extension at any time to stop all data processing

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
